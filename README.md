# RPD Crime Scene Log â€” Cloud Test App
This minimal Expo app lets you log in to Supabase, create a test scene, and call the export functions.
You'll build it on Expo's website (no installs on your computer).

## Edit your keys (after you upload to GitHub)
Edit `src/api/supabase.ts` in GitHub:
```
export const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://ozlqpnozfxverjespdbm.supabase.co';
export const SUPABASE_ANON = '<your anon key>';
```
